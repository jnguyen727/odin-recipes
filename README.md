I will make a recipes project. From this project, I will gain some experience as it pertains to committing and using GitHub in my projects; I have yet to do that before. I will also learn to make a project of my own --- without much help at all. 

I will also use some new commands; I have not used many GitHub commands before, this will help me see what it is like to work as a Programmer.
